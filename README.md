Creation of Network in EEG data, application of Community detection, and EEG analysis

In this study, an EEG dataset containing features such as Differential
Entropy (DE), Power Spectral Density (PSD), and Hemispheric Asymme-
try (ASM) is analyzed. The dataset was recorded from fifteen subjects who
watched fifteen film clips, with the goal of examining how these features might
differ across individuals and emotions. Therefore, an expansive study of the
EEG data in the world of graph theory is undertaken.
Four community detection algorithms, including the Louvain method, the
Girvan-Newman, the Walk-Trap, and the Fast Greedy partition methods, are
employed to assess significant similarities and dissimilarities among the subject
features in the context of networks and communities. More specifically, EEG
network features annotated by gender and emotion are compared.
The analysis reveals that gamma is isolated with no connections. Simi-
larities are found in the brain activity between female and male participants
during the watching of neutral film clips. Additionally, other male and female
testees exhibit beta wave similarities during the watching of the film clip that
evokes sad emotions. The results suggest a more intricate interaction between
emotions and brain activity in the last community, which encompasses mul-
tiple film clips, emotion labels, and brain activity patterns. This community
may indicate a diverse range of emotional experiences and cognitive processes
occurring concurrently.
